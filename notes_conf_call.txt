feeling too large

picture of document from meeting

fix pc font.
nav too much embossing

say layout looks clumsy, not clean like tesla

need to talk about specific CPT stuff.


growth strategy, branding, digital domination
logo flush with page edge
page title should be inline with navigation
scrollspy should be narrow, width of logo

tesla logo sticking down

make dialog logo same size as tesla

wider hero images, wide on top to bottom

font, shitty embossing
shoring up homepage, make it look like old psd, not templated look
smb, alignment, logo shrink

static color logo!!
