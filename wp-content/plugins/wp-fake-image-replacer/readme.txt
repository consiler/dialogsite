WP Fake Image Replacer generates fake post thumbnail images. Useful in theme development process. Now works with ACF fields.

== Description ==

When developing a theme, you need to insert dummy content to test if your content is well rendered. Maybe sometimes, you'll want to change pictures sizes in the middle of the development process for example, and then youâ€™ll need either to upload back your pictures or regenerate thumbnails. This is where this plugin kicks in.

With WP Fake Image Replacer you don't need to upload pictures. Just use the_post_thumbnail() function wherever you want and the plugin auto generate a fake image holder. Just change the thumbnail size whenever you want and the plugin generates automatically a new fake image.

It's work with ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) from version 4.0. Just use image and gallery fields as usual.

Switch to presentation mode : show your client the website with beautiful random pictures from Flickr. Uses Flickr API.
